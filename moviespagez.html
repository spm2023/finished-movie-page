			<p>A horror movie in every aspect but traditional, this movie has you rooting for an ending you know is impossible. District 9 portrays the very real reality of immigrants, except with the fantastical twist of aliens. This movie opens your eyes to hardships that truly exist for real humans, but with an added layer of strangeness, body horror, and a main character you don’t want to root for but feel sympathetic towards anyway. If you’re looking for a film that will leave you both devastated and overwhelmed with disappointment, this is certainly that film. </p>

		<p>As opposed to District 9, Shoplifters is a movie that you are constantly rooting for the main characters. Despite their flaws, which make them even more relatable, the main characters at their core want to find happiness and bring happiness to one another. This movie tackles the impact of abuse, motherhood, and how riches are not only measured in wealth. However, the ending of this movie, like all of it throughout, will strike you with a realistic look at society and how it approaches the unconventional family. Angry tears will appear, just warning you! </p>
