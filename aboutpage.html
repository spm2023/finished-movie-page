		<h4 class="titles"> -Roger Ebert, Film Critic </h4>
		<p> The inspiration for this film comes from my lifetime love for movie theaters and movie watching. As a child movie theaters often held a sense of awe and transported me to places near and far. </p>

		<p>However, in my years of film studies and growing up on the internet, I have found that some movies are made purely to be made. To entertain. To watch once and be done with it. Especially in an age when movies come and go so frequently, some of which never get their moment in the spotlight, I find it difficult to connect to movies as I once did as a child.</p>

		<p>Maybe it is the cyncisim that comes with adulthood or the loss of naivety, but most media no longers leaves a strong impact on me. Yet there are many movies that warrant conversation, close/critical watching, or just touch on human feelings and experiences in a way like no other. It is these films that I would like to highlight. Perhaps you've heard of them, or they're completely new to you. </p>
