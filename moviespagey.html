		<p>Released in 2018, Sorry To Bother You was directed by Boots Riley. It focuses on the main character, Cassius “Cash” Green as he begins a new job as a telemarketer, where he adopts an alternate white persona in order to garner success in his position. With impactful themes such as race, capitalism, and corporate conspiracy, my first time watching this film it not only made me feel as though I just experienced an out of body experience, it opened my eyes to an underlying fear I believe we all have this day in age: the fear of power and the unknowns of those with power. This film was one that had a plot twist I most certainly didn’t see coming, and provides such a unique experience that will likely never be replicated or forgotten.

		<p> Based on Iain Reid’s debut 2016 novel of the same name, this Netflix film follows a woman and her fairly new boyfriend on a trip to visit his parents for the first time. Having both read the book and seen the film, this film changes your perception of the characters in such a monumental way at the end, that it leaves you wondering if you should rewatch/re-read the story again just to see if you missed the clues. A thriller that utilizes the unknown and the displaced feeling of the unfamiliar, this story leaves the viewer wanting more and questioning everything. If you want a good story for the winter/fall season that won’t completely terrify you, but also make you a little uncomfortable, highly recommended. </p>
