			<p> Shower, a 1999 film directed by Zhang Yang, is based in China and follows a family who owns a local bathhouse on the verge of closing due to the industrialization and modernization of China’s smalltowns. In contrast to Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, this film centers itself in realism and the impact of time on multiple generations of families, community, and what constitutes a home. It certainly makes you want to sit back and appreciate what you have, and mourn what you’ve lost. If you, like me, sometimes want a movie that will guarantee some tears, this is a great choice. </p>

			<p>A recent, and rightfully, popular film Everything, Everywhere, All At Once needs no introduction. We have all sat there and wondered what would have happened if we made all the ‘right’ choices, or said yes instead of no, or listened to our parents just that once. We have all sat back and questioned if our lives had the potential for so much more, and if we’ve missed every opportunity for improvement. And we have certainly all been confronted with the inevitable: that we may not accomplish all that we set out to do within our ephemeral lives. This film encapsulates all of that, in both a devastating but also reassuring way. It highlights the miniscule aspects of our life that deserve credit, and makes us aware that the what ifs don’t always equate to greener pastures. </p>
